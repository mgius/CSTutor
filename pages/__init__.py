Pages Module

Contains classes and operations related to a page. This includes operations on quizzes, lessons, as well as pages in general. In our design, a course contains pages. These pages form the "tree" structure of a Course that can be seen in the navigation bar. The Page object itself is not used in this program, instead Lessons and Quizzes (which are both pages) are used.

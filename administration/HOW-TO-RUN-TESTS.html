<ul>
<li>Open a terminal</li>
<li>Navigate to the implementation folder</li>
<li>type <tt>make test</tt> to run all tests</li>
<li>Output is to console</li>
</ul>

<p>The line in implementation/courses/views.py in the show_roster function

<pre>failedList = request.session['badusers']
del request.session['badusers']</pre>

cannot be tested because it requires a file upload that cannot be simulated by the django test runner.

<br />
<br />
In addition, the line in implementation/courses/views.py in the add_from_file fucntion

<pre>failedList = addUsersFromFile(course, request.FILES) 
request.session['badusers']=failedList
return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('courses.views.show_roster', \
args=[course_slug]))</pre>

cannot be tested because it requires an uploaded file that cannot be simulated by the django test runner.

<p><b>Un-coverable tests Russel Mezzetta:</b></p>
<p>In users/views.py the "show_login" view cannot test
one line because this version of Django does not let you craft request objects
which contain both GET and POST data.</br></br> Rest assured that the test is trivial. It would test that Django's @login_required decorator properly passes a GET dictionary containing a key 'next' with the value of the next url to redirect to after succesful login. This functionality has been shown to work through user testing.
</br></br>
All of my other formally tested functions and views have 100% coverage

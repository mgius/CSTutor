<h2>Hosted website environment</h2>
<p>
Our project is hosted at 
<a href="https://autotutor.csc.calpoly.edu/demo/">https://autotutor.csc.calpoly.edu/demo/</a>
<br /><br />

Test data has been loaded.  Several users exist that can be logged in.  Of note
are the "mgius" user, who is the course owner of the CPE102 course, and "jinloes"
who is the course owner of the CPE103 course. 
<br />
Creating new users/courses works, and creating new lessons is working as well.
<br />
Debugging output has been left enabled, so "error" pages will include ugly
python stack traces.

<h3>Setting up project using Apache and mod_python</h3>
<p>
These instructions assume a reasonable knowledge of Apache and it's
configuration, and a full configuration help for Apache is available at the
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/">Apache Documentation Site</a>.
</p>
<p>
TODO: Mark needs to fill in basic Apache + mod_python here
</p>
<p>
Our site does not depend upon Apache or mod_python in any way.  Any supported
Django server setup should work with our site.  If you have interest in a 
non Apache + mod_python hosting solution, please consult the Django 
<a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/howto/deployment/">Deployment Documentation</a>
</p>
<h3>Known Bugs</h3>

Our ticket tracker is available at <a href="https://autotutor.csc.calpoly.edu/trac/report/1">https://autotutor.csc.calpoly.edu/trac/report/1</a>

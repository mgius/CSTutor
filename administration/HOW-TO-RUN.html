<h2>Hosted website environment</h2>
<p>
Our project is hosted at 
<a href="https://autotutor.csc.calpoly.edu/demo/">https://autotutor.csc.calpoly.edu/demo/</a>
<br /><br />

Test data has been loaded.  Several users exist that can be logged in.  Of note
are the "mgius" user, who is the course owner of the CPE102 course, and "jinloes"
who is the course owner of the CPE103 course. 
<br />
Creating new users/courses works, and creating new lessons is working as well.
<br />
Debugging output has been left enabled, so "error" pages will include ugly
python stack traces.

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<p>
Our ticket tracker is available at <a href="https://autotutor.csc.calpoly.edu/trac/report/1">https://autotutor.csc.calpoly.edu/trac/report/1</a>

The "edit" button does not appear for all locations.

Most statistic related functions do not work.

The course/page list on the left hand side is ugly and out of order.

Editing Quizzes isn't really implemented yet (although the interface is laid out)

</li>

The site is generally ugly.

member is assigned one or more requirements files, most likely more than one.

As specification file assignments are determined, fill in the
<strong>Specification Files</strong> column for each team member; these are the
.rsl files stored in the project <tt>specification</tt> directory.  Each team
member is assigned one or more .rsl files, typically the parts of the
specification that correspond to the parts of the requirements that each team
member works on.

</b></span><b>02:32 - 03:30 PM, 14 October 2009</b></p>

<p><b>Discussion with Professor Fisher:</b></p>
<p>Include a functionality to show, after taking a quiz, what the instructor's expectation is for your quiz score
The student can't see other students' statistics.</p>
<p>Suggested to have an FAQ, perhaps for each lesson. We decided it would be better to have a lesson type
of FAQ that should be viewable with associated lesson.</p>
<p>Professor wants a form of built in chat and remote access so he can control student's screen.</p>
<p>We discussed having a comment thread in each lesson.</p>
<p>Professor likes authentication on demand but we don't. </p>
<p>Professor wants a graphical flow chart view of the lesson flow.</p>
<p>We decided to have an instructor client and a student client.</p>
<p>Student must login or use anonymous option however, the Instructor client will allow for 
offline work in order to create lessons.</p>
<p><b>Our Discussion W/O Professor:</b></p>
<p>Four permissions. View, Edit, View Stats, Edit Permissions.</p>
<p>View permisson added by default.</p>
<p>Public and private option on classes. Private requires a moderator of sorts to okay a username request. 
However, the public option does not require that.</p>
<p>Include functionality to invite people to class.</p>
<p>Meeting Sunday 3pm library.</p>

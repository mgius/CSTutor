<br><br>prepare for friday's presentation

<br><br>Click profile to change user password. Can remove yourself from a class.
Possibly add email and personal info.

<br><br>Need to talk to Fisher. We'd like to only allow quiz's as prerequisites.
A lesson as a prerequisite is not useful because students could 
easily just click on a lesson and get past the prerequisite requirements.

<br><br>We hate prerequisites.

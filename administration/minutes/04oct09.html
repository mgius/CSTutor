<p class="p5"><b>Discussion of splash screen:</b> Pictures drawn. Mark will upload electronic version. Class/Lesson picked here. Login/pass. Register Login. Guest Mode. Admin Mode.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Discussion of student screen:</b> Pictures drawn. Mark will upload electronic version. Left side navigation. Heirarchy of topics. Shell in bottom of window. Has run and clear buttons. Rest of screen for lesson/quiz text. Possible to have button in the lesson that populate the shell with code. Note: a quiz should be able to be left at any time.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Discussion of admin screen:</b> Pictures drawn. Mark will upload electronic version. Initial page is home. Home could contain a lot of things, not quite decided. Options located at top: home, editor, stats, user management, logout.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Discussion of editor screen:</b> Pictures drawn. Mark will upload electronic version. Navigation on left side. Save, load, preview at top. Preview takes you to student mode with a button to bring you back to admin/edit mode. Options where shell would be in student mode. Lesson source where lesson would be in student mode. Options: add, remove, delete, move... lessons, set prerequisites. When creating new page, ask if lesson or quiz or whatever other types we have.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Discussion of quiz editor screen:</b> Much like the regular editor except options differ and may have buttons to create quiz source instead of html. Options: grade requirement(to pass), add/del/move question. Check which answer is correct method TBD.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Discussion of statistics screen(s):</b> Should be able to view aggregate statistics, perhaps in pie chart. One view discussed a table with rows: user1,user2.. and columns quiz1, quiz2 with scores in the intersection. Another view for individual quiz: rows of user1, user2... columns of question1, question2 with their answer (a,b,c,d,e) in the intersection. Perhaps highlight cell if correct. View individual student include time spent on each test or page, score, answers.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b>Questions For Professor Fisher:</b></p>
<p class="p5">Should we have fill in the blank? If so the teacher would need to grade manually. However, we think in the spirit of instant feedback we should shy away from fill in the blank questions.</p>
<p class="p5">Should we allow multiple answers on a multiple choice question such as "click all that apply". Radio button vs. check box. </p>

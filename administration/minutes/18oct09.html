<p>Discussion of login on demand, working offline on lessons and submitting requires authentication.</p>

<p>Shooting down the offline features.</p>

<p>Latest upload of a lesson overwrites the previous version.</p>

<p>Should we do offline? Web-based?</p>

<p>Could open a tarbal of javascript to essentially fake the web app for when users are offline so that the instructor could create lessons offline. Then could upload those later.</p>

<p>If logged in online it works as usual but if offline you can use the tarbal offline version. It can generate the xml for a lesson. You are required to log in to the regular interface to upload.</p>

<p>Save: uploads to server, or saves to local, or complains if you're not connected.</p>
<p>Export: generates xml</p>
<p>Import: uploads xml</p>

<p>Decided to ask teacher about offline mode. We don't like it.</p>

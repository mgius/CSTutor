Courses Module

Contains classes and operations related to a course. This includes the courses, their rosters aka enrollments, and any operations done explicitly to a course. 
A course is the top level organizational structure in CSTutor.  

A Course is composed of a number of Pages (Lessons and Quizzes).   
In addition, a Course can be private.  If so, users must first enroll in the Course in order to view that Course.

The Enrollment model links a User to Course, implicitly forming a Roster.

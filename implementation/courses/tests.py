		Test fixtures include two courses, one private and one public, and

		one user who is enrolled in the public course, and one user who
		is enrolled in neither. Another user is an admin for a course, which
		allows a roster to be managed. There is also a user that is not enrolled
		in any courses, so he can be enrolled in a course.

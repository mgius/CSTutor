''' CSTutor implementation in Python with Django web framework

	Folder hierarchy defines packages.  Each package contains:
	<b>models.py<b>: Class definitions for persistent data structures
	<b>views.py<b>: functions called by the user by hitting various site URLs
	<b>classname.py<b>: methods for each class defined in models.py

	CSTutor uses the DJango testing suit for unit testing. This provides framework to test
	function-unit testing, class-level inter-function testing, 
	system-level integration testing, and supports regression testing. 
	In addition, it can simluate front-end user interaction as well as back-end function testing.

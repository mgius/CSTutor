	This class runs test for Stats functions.

	This tests the insertStat function, and the various queries that 
	get information from stats. These tests depend on the StatTest
	fixture, which provides 2 courses, 2 users, and three 10-question 
	quizzes ind addation to the initalData.xml It also includes some
	statistics objects that are organized in such a way to produce easily
	known average, min and max values. 
	
	Due to the interpreted nature of Python, every function that is used in
	the code has at least one test. This is to ensure that the user will
	never see an embarrassing syntax error.

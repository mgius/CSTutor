	Users Module.
	
	This module/package contains all user related functions, views and models.
	The user related views are login, register new user, profile, etc...
	The user related functions are mainly helper/wrapper functions designed for use in processing user input such as the loginWrapper.
	The user related models are not explicity in our code because the django built-in user had all the functionality we required.

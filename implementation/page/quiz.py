@inject(Quiz)
def checkAnswers(answers, user = None)
	'''
	Given a set of answers from the user, checks those answers against the 
	solution, returning a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form
	(boolean, correctanswer), indicating whether or not the user got that
	question right and the correct answer for that question

	If a user is provided, store a stats entry for this user/quiz

	Returning the answers here because we're going to have to pull them from
	the database anyway, and if the caller is going to use them, we can save
	a potentially expensive database operation.

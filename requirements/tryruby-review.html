<h2>TryRuby</h2>

<li>Ability to move backwards in the tutorial<br>
</li>
<li>Can reset the session to give a fresh start</li>
<li>Acts just like a session in irb, the Ruby shell</li>
<li>Instructions have to be followed successfully to get to the next page</li>
<li>Instructions are simple and bite-sized<br>
</li></ul>
<h3>Bad Features</h3>
<ul><li>Only two chapters</li>
<li>Slower than using irb directly</li>
<li>No table of contents</li>

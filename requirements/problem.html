1.1.  Problem Statement
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The general problems to be addressed by the CSTutor project are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<li>
to provide a reliable and easy to use software tool that aides in tutoring
students taking Computer Science and Computer Engineering classes through
lessons and quizzes.
<li>
to provide a tool for each admin to add, delete and edit lessons and quizzes
<li>
to provide a central repository for storing and accessing lessons and quizzes.
</ol>
While these problems have been solved by a number of commercially available and
public domain products, the CSTutor provides a solution with certain
functional improvements over existing tools.  Specific problem areas are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<li>
a simple navigation system for browsing, joining and dropping classes
<li>
a visible user history of the user's progress through the class's lessons and quizzes
<li>
a section of the tutorial for editing and running example code
<li>
a way for instructors to track the progress of students through their class
<li>
a tool for organizing, adding, deleting and editing lessons within an instructor's class.
</ol>
</p><p>
The CSTutor project addresses the requirements of Gene Fisher and the CSC 
Department at Cal Poly.
They need a tool with a collection of features not available in any
single existing tool.  This aspect of the problem is one of combining a set of
existing features in a way that the features have yet to be combined in another
product.
</p><p>
In addition, the development of functioning software, the CSTutor project
focuses on three additional problems not addressed in other tools:
<ol type=a>
<li>
to provide integration of this tool with existing core CSC and CPE classes and 
their instructors and students.
<li>
to provide a pedagogical example for use in the instruction of software
engineering, including an example of the practical application of formal
methods
<li>
to provide fully documented, public domain source code for use by others
</ol>

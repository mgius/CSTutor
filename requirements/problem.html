1.1.  Problem Statement
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The general problems to be addressed by the CSCTutor project are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<li>
to provide a reliable and easy to use software tool that aides in tutoring
students taking Computer Science and Computer Engineering classes.
<li>
to provide a history of the user's progress and provide quizzes to gage
progress
<li>
to provide a tool for each admin to add, delete and edit lessons and quizzes

</ol>
While these problems have been solved by a number of commercially available and
public domain products, the CSCTutor provides a solution with certain
functional improvements over existing tools.  Specific problem areas are the
following:
<ol type=a>
<li>
visible user history
<li>
customizable lessons and quizzes for admins
<li>
an area for editing and writing code for practice
</ol>
</p><p>
The CSCTutor project addresses the requirements of a particular customer.
This customer needs a tool with a collection of features not available in any
single existing tool.  This aspect of the problem is one of combining a set of
existing features in a way that the features have yet to be combined in another
product.
</p><p>
In addition, the development of functioning software, the CSCTutor project
focuses on three additional problems not addressed in other tools:
<ol type=a>
<li>
to provide integration with schools and teachers
<li>
to provide a pedagogical example for use in the instruction of software
engineering, including an example of the practical application of formal
methods
<li>
to provide fully documented, public domain source code for use by others
</ol>

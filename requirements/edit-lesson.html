2.3.1.3  Editing a Class/Lesson
</h4>
</a>
<p>
An instructor is taken to an Edit Lesson screen in two ways
<br> <br>
1. The instructor has just created a new class or lesson and was taken this screen to fill in the main page.  The initial screen in this case would be blank(For more information, see "Creating new Classes/Lessons").
<br><br>
2. The instructor was browsing his or her lessons and classes and clicked on the "Edit" button.  The screen will be populated with the data for that lesson and will be editable by the instructor.
<br>
<br>

<hr>
</a>
<br>
To edit an existing lesson, the instructor will begin by browsing the lessons in the navigation bar.  The data will show up as though the instructor was following the lessons.  Once he or she finds the lesson, they first click on the topic to view it, then click on Edit to begin editing.
<br>
The editing screen will look the same when the instructor is editing lessons and classes except that classes will have Access Control List data to handle.
<br><br>
The instructor has different ways of editing the data within the lesson.  He or she can directly edit the text in the lesson, or can import files into the lesson(For more information see "Importing Data Into Lessons").  
<br>
For each page there is also a section for code that will be populated when the page is read.  When editing a page, an instructor will type in code into the code box.  This code will be shown and be able to be edited and executed by the student when the lesson is read.
<br>
Under the "Options" section there is also a list of Prerequisites to taking the lesson.  This list is defaulted to empty.  To add to the list of prequisites click "Add Prerequisite" and select from a list of quizzes that the student needs to have passed before doing this lesson.
<br><br>
If the instructor wants to see his or her editing progress without saving, there is a "Preview" button that will show the instructor what the lesson will look like.  From there they need to navigate back to the edit page to save.
<br><br>
When the instructor is satisfied with his or her edits, they will click the "Save" button.  This will save and submit any changes the instructor made to the lesson.

</h4>

<p>
An instructor is taken to an Edit Lesson screen in two ways
<br> <br>
1. The instructor has just created a new class or lesson and was taken this screen to fill in the main page.  The initial screen in this case would be blank(For more information, see "Creating new Classes/Lessons").
<br><br>
2. The instructor was browsing his or her lessons and classes and clicked on the "Edit" button.  The screen is populated with the data for that lesson and is editable by the instructor.

To edit an existing lesson, the instructor browses lessons in the navigation bar. 
Notice the selected lesson is highlighted. 
The data shows up as though the instructor was following the lessons. 
Once he or she finds the lesson, they first click on the topic to view it, 
then click on Edit to begin editing.

<b>Preview/Save button:</b>
Clicking the Preview/Save button saves the current edits.  The user is then
taken to a screen that shows the lesson a student would view it.
This does NOT make the changes visible to the students in the class.

<b>Save button:</b>
Clicking the Save button save the current edits only.  A save conformation 
appears if save is completed.

<b>Modify Prerequisites:</b> Clicking this button allows the instructor to pick from a list of previous 
quizzes. Selecting an item means that the Student cannot view the page without first completing
the selected quiz with the indicated score. When selecting a quiz the Instructor may select a minimum score

<br>Below exists a walkthrough illustrating how to use the tools to create the lesson seen on this page.
<br><br>After creating the lesson, CSTutor presents the user with a blank window. Clicking inside this window
allows the user to see a cursor and type text into the window. First the user types the title of the lesson
"Creating Arrays". Next the user decides to change the font of the title. To do this the user highlights the 
title then clicks the <b>Font</b> button.

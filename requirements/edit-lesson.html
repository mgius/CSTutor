CSTutor shows the Edit Lesson screen in two ways
<br> <br>
1. The instructor has just created a new class or lesson and is taken this screen to fill in the main page.  The initial screen in this case would be blank(For more information, see "Creating new Classes/Lessons").
<br><br>
2. A user with edit permissions is browsing his or her lessons and classes and clicked on the "Edit" button.  The screen is populated with the data for that lesson and is editable by the user.

To edit an existing lesson, the instructor browses lessons in the navigation bar.

then click on Edit to begin editing.

<br>A walkthrough exists below which illustrates how to use the tools to create the lesson seen on this page.
<br><br>After creating the lesson, CSTutor presents the user with a blank window. Clicking inside this window
allows the user to see a cursor and type text into the window. First the user types the title of the lesson
"Creating Arrays". Next the user decides to change the font of the title. To do this the user highlights the 
title then clicks the <b>Font</b> button.

<hr>

The Font tool presents the user with a list of available fonts. The user may scroll down to see more fonts.
While highlighting text, the Font tool instantly updates the highlighted text.
Clicking accept closes the font window.

<br><br>
Now the Instructor wishes to center the title of the page. To do this the Instructor highlights the title then
clicks the <b>Align</b> button which spawns an alignment dialogue.

The Align tool contains options for (L,C,R) left, center, and right justification. The tool highlights the current
alignment in yellow. Clicking any alignment instantly updates the highlighted text. Accept closes the tool 
window. Note: this tool aligns text, code boxes, and images.

<br><br>
To finalize the title the Instructor makes the text larger by clicking the <b>Size</b> button.

This button prompts the user for text size. The user clicks inside the box and simply types in the desired
text size. The text instantly changes size as the user modifies the size field. Clicking accept closes the 
Size tool.

<br><br>
The Instructor types more text but then decides to put in a link at the end of the paragraph to the java
sun array tutorial. To do this the Instructor clicks the <b>Link</b> button which brings up the Link tool.

on its own line at the user's cursor then closes the Image tool.
<br>NOTE:If the Instructor wishes to center the picture he must click on the picture to select it, then use 
the <b>Align</b> button.

<br><br>
The Instructor finishes off the lesson by adding in a code box by clicking the <b>Code</b> button.

The Code button inserts an empty code box much like an image (on its own line at the user's cursor). 
In order to fill in the code box the Instructor must click inside the code box and simply begin typing.

<br><br>
From here the Instructor may view the lesson from the Student's perspective by clicking <b>Preview/Save</b> 
or simply save his work by clicking <b>Save</b>. Once satisfied the Instructor can allow Students access to

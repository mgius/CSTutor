1.4.  Impacts
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The positive potential impacts of CSTutor include:
<ul>
<li>
Immediate feedback for students on both lecture material and quizzes.  No need
to wait for a grader to provide feedback.
<li>
Encourages experimentation with in-browser coding applets.
<li>
24 hour access to lesson material.  Students set their own schedule and pace.
<li>
New material available as soon as writer wants it to be.  No need to wait for
traditional distribution channels (email, paper handouts)
<li>
Gives students better context before seeking in-person help
</ul>
<p>
The negative potential impacts of CSTutor include:
<ul>
<li>
Less interaction between Student and Teacher
<li>
Poor impression of online tutoring due to badly designed lessons
<li>
Abuse by teachers as a replacement for real lectures/lessons
</ul>

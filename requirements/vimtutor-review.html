<h3>
1.5.1.  VimTutor
</h3>
<p>
Vimtutor is a great first step to learning vim.  It walks the user through
the basics of the editor, including a couple of "wow, cool!" features to
show how vim can improve productivity.  At it's core, it's simply a text file,
which is the environment where vim's features are strongest.  Because the 
tutor is just a text file that you edit with vim, the system employs a "learn
by doing" approach that drops you right into vim.

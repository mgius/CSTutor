<p>
For an instructor to add a new lesson for a class, he or she clicks on 
the "+" buttons located to the right of a topic on the navigation bar. 
This will create a subsection under the selected topic.  The following 
screen is shown and once completed, a new lesson is created.

Lesson name will take in the name of the lesson from the instructor. 
Once the instructor has entered the lesson name, they are able to submit 
their lesson.  The instructor is then taken to the edit screen for the 
main page of the lesson(More information can be found in "Editing 
Lessons").  The class will also be added to their navigation bar and 
the instructor will then be able to create sub-lessons for the created 
lesson.
<br>
Since a lesson can only be created as a subtopic and may be within another lesson, you get a directory like structure with classes containing lessons which have sub-lessons themselves.

4.  Developer Overview
</h2>

<p>
When implementing CSTutor, there are a few things to note before beginning
</p>
<ul>

<li>
Class/Lesson/Quiz Hierarchy
</li>

<li>
Executable Code
</li>

<li>
Published vs. Saved Pages
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=Hierarchy>
4.1 Class/Lesson/Quiz Hierarchy
</h3>
The Hierarchy of pages, or "Page Tree" is the overall structure of Classes.
<ul>
<li>
As noted in the specification, a Class is always the root of a Page 
Tree and the root of a Page Tree is always a Class.  That is, a Class never is a subpage 
and no Lesson or Quiz is a root of a Page Tree.
</li>
<li>
Within the Page Tree each node can have any amount of Lessons and Quizzes.
As noted in the specification, Lessons may have lessons and quizzes within
them.  However, Quizzes never have sublessons or subquizzes.  That is,
a quiz always is a leaf on the Page Tree.
</li>
<li>
As noted in the specification, each Page contains two other Page
IDs that represent the previous and next Pages.  This next/previous structure
follows a Preorder traversal of the Page Tree.  Pushing "Next Page" takes the 
user to the next node in the traversal and "Prev Page" takes the user to the 
previous node in the traversal.
</li>
</ul>

4.2 Executable Code
</h3>

Executable code is a difficult section to implement, especially if CSTutor
is web application.  

<ul>
<li>
There is a potential for security issues when unknown people are writing and 
executing code.
</li>
<li>
There is a potential for performance issues with non-terminating programs. 
</li>
<li>
Providing a reasonable response time is expected.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=PublishedSavedPages>
4.3 Published vs. Saved Pages
</h3>
It is important to distinguish between the Published version of a Page and the currently
Saved version.

<ul>
<li>
The Published version of a Page is visible to all who are enrolled in the Class.
</li>
<li>
The Saved version of the Page is the version that one of the owners is editing.
</li>
<li>
This opens up versioning issues with multiple editors.  For simplicity's sake, we 
recommend using a "Last Published Wins" philosophy.  That is, when a user publishes
a Saved page, it replaces the current Published page.
</li>
</ul>

1.2.  System Personnel
</h3>
</a>
<p>
The personnel involved in the CSTutor project are organized into the
following groups and subgroups:
</p>
	<ol type="a">

		<li>
end users

			<ol type="i">


				<li>
registered users
</li>
				<li>
professors / educators<br />
					</li>
				<li>
master system administrators
</li>
				<li>
anonymous users<br />
					</li>
			</ol>
</li>
		<li>
customers
</li>
		<li>
system developers
</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
End users are those who use the CSTutor for its intended purpose. Registered users are those using the CSTutor and whose progress is tracked and uploaded to the server. Professors / Edurcators are those who can use the tool to create lessons as well as view students progress and statistics..  Master system administrators perform overall
system administration functions, including user and professor/educator registration.
Finally, anyone can use the CSTutor as an anonymous user by simply not logging in or creating an account which does not identify themselves.
</p>
	<p>
The primary customer is Gene Fisher.  He is customer representative for his
faculty and staff colleagues in the Computer Science department at the
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.  In this
representative capacity, Fisher will consult with other potential customers to
gather requirements from them, and integrate their requirements with his own.
</p>
	<p>
The primary system developers are Mark Gius, Jon Inloes, Evan Kleist,  Russell Mezzetta, James Pearson, and Matthew Tytel. Their development activities
are all those of the software development process, from requirements analysis
through product implementation and deployment. They will also conduct the
ongoing process activities of testing, configuration, documentation, and
project management.

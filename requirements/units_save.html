<h3>2.6.6 Using Save in Lesson Editor</h3>
<p>
When a user clicks Save as described in <a href="edit-lesson.html#Save">Section 2.3.1.3</a>, CSTutor saves the current lesson into the working copy. 
<br><br>If this notion of a working
copy has not been previously explained then read the following. CSTutor provides a layer of security from data
deletion and accidental modification by keeping two copies of every lesson page. One copy is the working copy
which the instructor modifies while editing. The other copy is the published copy, which is presented to students
when they view lessons. This allows the instructor to make changes without students immediately seeing the changes.
To allow the students to view the changes the instructor must "Publish" them, see below.
</p>

When a user clicks Publish as described in <a href="edit-lesson.html#Publish">Section 2.3.1.3</a>, CSTutor saves the current lesson into the working copy

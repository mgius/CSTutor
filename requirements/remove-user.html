2.3.4.2 Deleting a User from the Class Roster
</h3>
</a>
<p>
This scenario shows the instructor of a class how to remove users from the class roster. 
Removing users is important because it allows the instructor to properly manage the class roster. 
In this scenario, we assume that the instructor has logged in, selected the appropriate class, and is viewing the roster page. 
Details of logging in as an instructor can be found in

<p>
To remove a user from the class roster, the instructor selects <tt>Delete User</tt> on the roster management screen and then the diaglog box shown in Figure 2.3.4.2-1 is displayed by the system.

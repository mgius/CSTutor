<em>Editorial Remark: This scenario illustrates a reasonably detailed level of
analysis, but some pictures and text are still missing.  For your Milestone 2,
you should have a few scenarios like this, where some of the details have been
worked out.  As the quarter progresses, all of the scenarios will be done to a
complete level of detail.</em>

This scenario shows how the instructor can preview a lesson. 
Previewing lessons is important because it allows the instructor to proofread the lesson and look at the layout of the lesson. 
In this scenario, we assume that the instructor has just logged into the appropriate class and is looking at the admin page. 
Details of logging in as a admin can be found in Section x.

To preview a lesson, the instructor selects Preview in the toolbar on the admin page.

1.3.  Operational Setting
</h3>
</a>
<p>
There are two operational settings for CSTutor: (1) normal use as a functioning software system; (2) use as a project in a software engineering course.
</p>

<p>
CSTutor is intended to be used by the Cal Poly Computer Science Department, most notably first-year students.  The system must then be able to operate on a variety of operating systems and standard home computer hardware.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, CSTutor is being used as project for one of the teams in Gene Fisher's afternoon Fall 308 class, and possibly for a team in the associated Winter quarter 309 section.  These courses are two-quarter sequences that cover standard aspects of software engineering, with emphasis on the practical application of formal methods. For the most part, the concepts covered in these courses, and hence the concepts embodied in the Calendar Tool, are mainstream software engineering. Other instructors may therefore find the Calendar Tool and its development artifacts useful as course examples.

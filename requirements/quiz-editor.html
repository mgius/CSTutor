	<h4>2.3.2 Using the Quiz Editor</h4>
	<p>The quiz editor is accessible to instructors or other privileged users for creating, editing, and deleting quizzes. In spirit of automated feedback, CSTutor only supports multiple choice, true or false, or code snippet questions. However, the instructor may wish to create several <a href="#Quiz_Versioning">versions</a> of the quiz in order to avoid repeat questions.</p>
	<p>The instructor is also able to set and edit properties of the quiz, such as <a href="#Managing_Prerequisites">prerequisites</a>. With prerequisites, the instructor can identiy which quizzes must be completed before being able to take the quiz. In some instances, an instructor may wish to make all quizs available immediatly in order to demonstrate knowledge in the subject without needing to go through the lessons. In other instances, an instructor may wish to unlock quizs and make them <a href="#Managing_Quiz_Visibility">visible</a> as previous quizzes are completed in order to create a flow for the course material. If a quiz is failed, the instructor may wish to have the student take a different <a href="#Quiz_Versioning">version</a> of the quiz so the student doesnt answer the same questions.</p>
	<p>Another feature of the quiz editor is the capabilities to use <a href="#Managing_Quiz_Paths">paths</a>. With quiz paths, the instructor can direct the student to a particular lesson based on the students score. For example, if a student scores below 60%, the student may be required to retake the lesson. If the student scores between 61% and 75%, the student could be encouraged to review the material before moving forward. If the student scores between 76% and 100%, the student may be automatically directed to the next lesson in the series.</p>

Finally, if the student scores 75% or above, he is not given a dialogue and is brought to the next lesson.</p>

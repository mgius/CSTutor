<p>
The "Chat" functionality is being provided by a third party application,
<a href=http://qwebirc.org/>qwebirc</a>.  The webirc application is coded
using python and javascript, and access to the application will be via a web
browser.  The "Chat" code does not interact with the rest of the CSTutor 
codebase in any way.  It is completely distinct.
